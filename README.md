### Quick URL Paste

This Firefox add-on allows to copy a URL and open a new tab with it in a single keystroke.

#### Purpose

I was annoyed to often select an URL, copy it in the clipboard, hit `<Ctrl> + T` to open a new tab and then paste the URL and, finally, hit `<Enter>` to open the page.

This very basic add-on allows me to do the same with only a selection and a keystroke.

Note that if there is no active selection, _QuickUrlPaste_ tries to use the current content of the clipboard. The keystroke can be configured.
